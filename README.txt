*** BACKGROUND ***
You might not know it but superheroes have super secret cake club, just like Nortal. Unfortunately none of them can bake
so they visit bakeries. 
For obvious reasons their monday mornings doesn't start with: "Batman stepped into a bakery".
They meet at some rooftop from where Superman flies to a bakery, empties the shelves and leaves money in the cash register.


It is always a hassle to find a rooftop to meet since no one wants to be the one that has to travel
the furthest. 
Chuck Norris once boasted he could write a program to find the best meeting spots. Since
roundhouse kicking a computer didn't work, he turned to us.


We have tried to create this program for him but he keeps roundhouse kicking everything all the time and
we cannot have such a customer. 
So we give you a chance to get this great name to your portfolio by
finishing the missing implementations in provided code and making MeetingLocationFinder work.
